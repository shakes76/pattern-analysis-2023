# Logistic Map
Let us model population growth using a very simple model. 

Despite its simplicity, we will show that even these system can exhibit complex behaviour. Let's use the Logistic map as a starting point $P = \lambda D_nB_n$ with $\lambda$ as the fertility, $B_n$ and $D_n$ as the birth and death rates at time $n$ respectively. Replacing $B_n$ with standard notation $x_n$ and writing death as a function of births, we get our equation as $x_{n+1}=\lambda\cdot x_n (1-x_n)$
